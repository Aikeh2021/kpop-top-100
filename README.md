## Inspiration

Korean Popular Music, or K-pop, really began to flourish in the 1990s. The final decade of the Twentieth Century closed on a high note with K-pop unveiling a new formula for discography that would keep the fans wanting more.
After borrowing elements from other well established genres like Hip Hop and Rap, Korean artists combined catchy beats with angsty rhymes to capture the hearts of South Korea's youth. To take things a step further, these tracks were accompanied by stylized choreography, visually appealing music videos, and perfect live performances.

Though the First and Second Generations of K-pop were the more nostalgic and unprecedented of the generations, this website will focus on the Third Generation. This content covers music released from 2010-2019. The reason being that this is the decade more American audiences may refer to as "throwback" since it is most likely when they began tuning into the globe sweeping phenomenon.

The purpose of this application is to create a list of the top ten most listened to K-pop songs of the last decade. In addition, users will be exposed to almost 1000 popular K-pop songs of the time. If you are looking to get sucked into the rapidly growing world of K-pop, this is the place to start.

## User Story

## Design

K-pop fashion is constantly evolving! One of the groups famous for changing with the trends is a group called f(X). The design for this website was based off two of their biggest hits: 
* Electric Shock

and

* Four Walls

This website's design focuses on the bold neon color pallete used in the Electric Shock music video, but also incorporates the crisp and clean lines that came during the abstract 70s inspired stage performances of their song Four Walls.

Though the website's appearance is simple, it packs just enough punch to keep the user on the application.

The focus should be the music. So I think the design should take a backseat to the main purpose of this application.
